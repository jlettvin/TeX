# TeX
typesetting system rewritten in javascript

[Try it out](https://rawgit.com/jlettvin/TeX/master/index.html)

Currently, the TeX source is echoed as &lt;PRE&gt; text.
The up-to-date ANSI C code is found in the ANSIC directory.
This code will be converted to javascript and
instead of rendering to paper equivalent postscript or PDF
it will be rendered directly into an HTML5 canvas.
