\begin{document}

  This is a very simple file, though it does include some mathematical 
  symbols, $\beta, x$ and $y$,  and some equations,  
\begin{equation} 
 \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{7}{10}. 
\end{equation} 
 
 The equations are automatically numbered:
\begin{equation} 
 1 + 1 = 2 \Rightarrow E = m c^2.  
\end{equation}  

 \TeX\ can handle complicated mathematical expressions. 
\begin{equation} 
 \int_0^\infty \cos (k t) e^{-s t} d t = \frac{s}{s^2 + k^2}
\end{equation} 
 if $s > 0$. 
\begin{equation}
 e^z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{ z^n}{n!} . 
\end{equation} 

 Leave a blank line in your file when you want a new paragraph. 
      \TeX\ will automatically 
 arrange your text
              into tidy lines of 
 even length, even 
 if the 
 original text in the .tex file is a mess. 

 This is additional text to force a new page to be
 generated to test the auto-paging mechanism
 in the first RAW render.
 The comment line should appear on page 2.
 If it does not, the mechanism failed.

\end{document}
